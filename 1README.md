# Abstract

*A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?*

In this project, we would like to determine what makes a successful Airbnb housing. 
To do so, we will be working with the data set provided by the website http://insideairbnb.com/index.html. On this website are datasets for a hundred cities across the world. These datasets provide information about every airbnb housing in these cities, their host's name, the location (geographic coordinates and the neighborhood), the rooms type, the price and more. 

A first phase of the research would be to focus on the data from the ten most visited cities in Europe. These are : 
1. London    2. Paris    3. Istanbul    4. Roma    5. Prague
6. Milan    7. Barcelona    8. Amsterdam    9. Vienna    10. Venice
In this section we would like to assess the popularity of airbnb as well as its impact on the housing. We expect this to be achieved by looking at the localization and amount of airbnbs homes but also how many days per year are these homes for rent for example. 

A second phase would be to compare results from highly visited cities with:
* Very touristic cities outside of europe to see if these results could be generalized to an international level.
* European less touristic cities to find out how the growth of airbnb housing is correlated (or not) with the amount of tourists that come to a specific town.
* Touristic cities from emerging countries in order to again get an idea of airbnb popularity.

# Research questions
*A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.*
Through these analyses we expect to answer the questions:
* Under which conditions is a city likely to have high concentration of airbnb housings? 
* What criteria influences the renting rate of an airbnb?
* How are airbnb housings geographically distributed, have they taken over neighborhoods?
